# What is a chatbot?
A chatbot is defined as A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. It can be looked upon as a virtual assistant that communicates with users via text messages and helps businesses in getting close to their customers. It is a program designed to imitate the way humans communicate with each other. It can be done through a chat interface or by voice call. Developers usually design chatbots so that it is difficult to tell for users whether they are communicating with a person or a robot.

### Chatbots helps any business/organization in accomplishing the following goals:
* Increases operational efficiency.
* Automating customer request fulfillment.
* Handling basic queries, which in turn free employees to work for complex & higher value inquiries.
* Offers Multi-language support.
* Saves time & effort by automating customer support.
* Improves the response rate as well as customer engagement.
* Personalization of communication

### How Does a Chatbot Work?
Chatbots are nothing but software applications that have an application layer, a database, and APIs. To simplify the working of the chatbot, we can say it works on pattern matching to classify text and produce a suitable response for the questions/queries addressed by the user. The chatbot responds to the user as per the program that has been fed in it. Chatbots are of different types, depending on how they are used. Mainly there are three types of chatbots, and they are as follows:

* Rule-Based Chatbot: This is the basic chatbot made, the user interacts with this kind of bot by using predefined options. To get answers from these bots, users need to click on certain options. These kinds of bots collect the user's request, analyze it, and then offer results in the form of buttons. These bots are commonly used to replace frequently asked questions when it comes to complex queries; they aren't always the best solution.

* Independent(Keyword) Chatbots: These are machine learning bots, unlike rule-based chatbots, they analyze what the user wants and respond appropriately. These chatbots use customizable keywords and machine learning to determine how to respond to users' requests effectively and efficiently.

* NLP (Contextual) Chatbots: These are so far the most advanced chatbots. They are a combination of best from rule-based and keyword chatbots. These chatbots use NLP to understand the context and intent in users' requests and thus act accordingly. These chatbots can handle multiple requests from the same user at ease.
